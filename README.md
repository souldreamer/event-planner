## Installation
* run `npm install`
* run `npm run serve` (will compile, lint,
create `./dist/` folder, copy everything into
it, and start `browser-sync` & your browser)

*Attention*: don't run `gulp` directly, as I'm
using *`gulp` v4.0-alpha*. If you **really**
want to do it, either have `gulp#4.0` installed
globally or run `node node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js *command*`
